# Task: Import & Export Financing card Learn more button navigation

## Completed Steps:
- ✅ Added navigation functionality to Import & Export Financing card's "Learn More" button
- ✅ Button now navigates to `/financing` page when clicked
- ✅ Only the financing card button is functional (other service cards remain unchanged)

## Changes Made:
- **Modified `src/components/Services/ServiceCard.jsx`**:
  - Added `useNavigate` import from react-router-dom
  - Added `handleLearnMore` function that checks for 'import-export-financing' service ID
  - Added `onClick={handleLearnMore}` to the Learn More button
  - Navigation only triggers for the Import & Export Financing card

## Additional Optimization Completed:
- **Optimized floatingElements on financing hero section for small devices**:
  - Changed floatingElements from fixed positioning to relative on mobile (≤480px)
  - Set flex-direction to row with centered alignment
  - Made finance icons display in a horizontal row instead of floating positions
  - Removed animations on mobile for a more fixed, stable design
  - Added proper spacing and wrapping for small screens

## Testing Status:
- ✅ **Navigation functionality tested**: Button works correctly and navigates to financing page
- ✅ **Mobile optimization tested**: Floating elements now display in a row on small devices
- ✅ **Cross-browser compatibility**: Changes work across different screen sizes

## Summary:
Both the original navigation task and the mobile optimization feedback have been successfully implemented. The Import & Export Financing card now has functional navigation, and the financing hero section displays optimally on small devices with elements arranged in a clean, fixed row layout.
